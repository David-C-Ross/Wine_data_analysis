# Wine_data_analysis

In this repository I analyzed the white wine data set found at [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
I used a variety of approaches such as a SVM with a rbf kernel, neural network and clustering algorithms to predict the quality of the wine based on the given
meta-data:
* sulfur dioxide
* free sulfur dioxide
* residual sugar
* fixed acidity"
* volatile acidity
* alcohol
* sulphates
* pH
* density
* citric acid
* chlorides

The main libraries I used on this project are:
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seabas
* Sklearn
* Pytorch
